<p>As New York City begins to heal from the blows dealt during the pandemic, much of the Bronx’s youth are not feeling that relief.
Known as “disconnected youth”, they are teenagers and young adults, aged between 16 to 24 years old, who are either not currently attending or enrolled at an educational institution, or who are currently unemployed.

<p>According to a survey conducted in 2020 by Measure for America, a database dedicated to tracking youth disconnection across the country, about 33,000 teens and young adults in the Bronx currently qualify as “disconnected.” Making the Bronx the borough with the highest number of disconnected youth in New York City.
According to Measure of America, the main factors affecting youth come from a variety of socioeconomic factors such as poverty,lack of access to education programs and job opportunities, and an absence of a familial or community support system.
However, other factors such as transportation and lack of access to affordable childcare impact a young parent's ability to get to work as well. Current census data shows that there is a decline in
youth disconnection, however, Measure of America predicts that the gains that were made since these programs were implemented will be temporarily lost. As of yet, there is no definitive timeline as to when they will return.

    “We have to reach back into the community. Especially if they’re trying to elevate the kids,” said Farah Despeignes, Community Education Council President of District 8, which covers the South Bronx. Despeignes believes that the beginning to solving the issue of youth disconnection begins not in the classroom but at home.

 “If the community is under-sourced and underserved then the kids won’t be able to get the support, because the primary support always comes from the family and the community,” said Despeignes.
 She sees that the stronger the foundation a child has to stand on, the greater a chance they have at rising to their potential.
